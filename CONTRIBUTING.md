### üîß Code Contributions

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/your-username/legal-research-engine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abeginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code
- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/your-username/legal-research-engine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- LM Studio (for local testing)

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/legal-research-engine.git
   cd legal-research-engine
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv legal_env
   source legal_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: legal_env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

5. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

6. Create a branch for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements*.txt             # Dependencies
```

### Local Development

1. **Start LM Studio**: Ensure LM Studio is running locally on port 1234
2. **Run tests**: `python -m pytest tests/`
3. **Start the app**: `streamlit run app.py`
4. **Make your changes**: Edit the relevant files
5. **Test your changes**: Run both automated tests and manual testing

### Adding New Features

When adding new features:

1. **Create tests first** (Test-Driven Development)
2. **Update documentation** as you go
3. **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase
4. **Add type hints** where appropriate
5. **Include error handling**

## Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with some additional conventions:

- **Line length**: 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports, group them properly
- **Type hints**: Required for all public functions
- **Docstrings**: Google style for all public functions/classes

### Code Formatting

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort src/ tests/

# Lint code
flake8 src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat(langgraph): add precedent analysis agent
fix(ui): resolve chat interface scrolling issue
docs: update API documentation for new endpoints
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_langgraph_workflow.py

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Name test files `test_*.py`
- Use descriptive test names: `test_should_extract_citations_from_legal_document`
- Follow the AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

Example test:
```python
def test_should_generate_case_brief_with_valid_input():
    # Arrange
    generator = CaseBriefGenerator()
    document = Document(page_content="Sample legal content", metadata={})
    
    # Act
    result = generator.generate_case_brief(document)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.case_name is not None
    assert len(result.legal_issues) > 0
```

### Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions/methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure acceptable response times
