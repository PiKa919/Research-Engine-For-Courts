Below is a **detailed, actionable roadmap** to deliver the  *AI-Driven Research Engine for Commercial Courts (SIH1701)* : where to get each dataset, which research and engineering components to build, an annotation plan, evaluation, and **free vs paid deployment** options. I researched current Indian legal data sources, Indic NLP assets, retrieval and vector DB choices, and retrieval/LLM best practices and cite the sources I used.

---

# High-level plan (4 major phases)

1. **Discovery & data collection (2–4 weeks)** — gather judgments, cause-lists, statutes, and commercial-court specific materials; decide licenses/agreements.
2. **Core infra & indexing (3–6 weeks)** — ingest, normalize, build full-text + vector indexes (hybrid search).
3. **Legal NLP models & pipelines (6–10 weeks)** — extraction (issues, holdings, reliefs), citation extraction + graph, summarization, multilingual support.
4. **Frontend + workflows, evaluation & deployment (4–8 weeks)** — RAG UI, brief export, risk estimator, testing, and host (prototype vs production).

(These are modular — you can produce a demo in ~8–10 weeks if you focus on a single High Court / Supreme Court subset.)

---

# 1) Data sources — what to get and where

These are the primary, reliable sources for Indian judgments, cause lists and metadata.

* **eCourts / Judgments Portal (bulk + search)** — official judgments portal and judgment search; eCourts provides full-text judgments and metadata. Useful for scraping / bulk ingest. ([judgments.ecourts.gov.in](https://judgments.ecourts.gov.in/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Home | Judgements and Orders, Supreme Court and High courts of ..."), [Department of Justice](https://doj.gov.in/judgment-search-portal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Judgment Search Portal | Department of Justice | India"))
* **National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG)** — case metadata, large scale case statistics and (where published) links to orders/judgments. Good for volume and case lifecycle metadata. ([NJDG](https://njdg.ecourts.gov.in/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "National Judicial Data Grid: NJDG"), [Department of Justice](https://doj.gov.in/the-national-judicial-data-grid-njdg/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) | Department of Justice | India"))
* **Supreme Court & High Courts repositories** — Supreme Court judgments are also available in bulk/open datasets (AWS Open Data registry, Kaggle backups). Use these for stable, canonical corpora. ([Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/indian-supreme-court-judgments/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Indian Supreme Court Judgments - Registry of Open Data on AWS"), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vangap/indian-supreme-court-judgments?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Indian Supreme Court Judgments | Kaggle"))
* **Indian Kanoon / commercial APIs** — for fast lookup and supplemental documents; IndianKanoon exposes an API (paid tiers exist) that can speed development and provide extra crawling. (Use carefully — check TOS.) ([api.indiankanoon.org](https://api.indiankanoon.org/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Indian Kanoon API - Home"))
* **Commercial providers (optional/paid)** — Manupatra, SCC Online, AIROnline for curated citations/metadata and better OCR/annotations (paid, useful for production). ([aironline.in](https://www.aironline.in/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "AIROnline | Indian Legal Database | Legal Research"))

**Practical downloads / starter sets**

* Start with Supreme Court bulk (AWS Open Data / Kaggle) to build pipelines and models, then add selected High Courts and Commercial Court judgments as you go. ([Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/indian-supreme-court-judgments/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Indian Supreme Court Judgments - Registry of Open Data on AWS"), [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adarshsingh0903/legal-dataset-sc-judgments-india-19502024?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Legal Dataset: SC Judgments India (1950–2024) - Kaggle"))

---

# 2) Data engineering & preprocessing (what to build)

Goal: Convert heterogeneous PDFs/HTML into clean, searchable, annotated documents.

Tasks:

* **Crawler/harvester** : use/extend existing tools (openjustice-in/ecourts, vanga repo) to pull judgments, cause-lists, orders. ([GitHub](https://github.com/openjustice-in/ecourts?utm_source=chatgpt.com "openjustice-in/ecourts: Python library to help scrape Indian Court ..."))
* **OCR & text cleaning** : run OCR (Tesseract / commercial OCR for poor scans); apply post-processing to normalize sections (Bench, Date, Citations).
* **Document schema** : JSON with fields — court, bench, case_no, parties, date, acts/sections, citations (extracted), full_text, language, pdf_url, docket events. Use Parquet for efficient storage. (vanga/ecourts repos show example metadata layouts.) ([GitHub](https://github.com/vanga/indian-supreme-court-judgments?utm_source=chatgpt.com "vanga/indian-supreme-court-judgments - GitHub"))
* **Language ID + script normalization** : use IndicLID / Indic NLP tooling to detect language and transliteration/normalization. ([GitHub](https://github.com/AI4Bharat/IndicLID?utm_source=chatgpt.com "AI4Bharat/IndicLID: Language Identification for Indian ... - GitHub"))
* **Metadata enrichment** : link statutes and sections (gazette / bare acts) and embed jurisdiction tags (Commercial Court bench vs civil).

---

# 3) Retrieval & index design (RAG foundation)

Goal: fast, hybrid search that supports legal QA and citation grounding.

Design choices:

* **Hybrid search** : combine lexical search (OpenSearch/Elasticsearch) + dense vectors (ColBERT or embedding-based + ANN). ColBERT v2 is a strong option for legal retrieval and has PyTerrier bindings. ([GitHub](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT?utm_source=chatgpt.com "stanford-futuredata/ColBERT - GitHub"))
* **Vector DB options** :
* **Open / self-hosted** : Milvus or Weaviate — good if you want full control and avoid vendor lock-in. Milvus has strong OSS background; Weaviate adds GraphQL and semantic schema features. ([Milvus](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/how-does-milvus-compare-to-other-vector-databases-like-pinecone-or-weaviate?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How does Milvus compare to other vector databases like Pinecone ..."))
* **Managed (paid)** : Pinecone or managed Weaviate Cloud — easier ops, SLA. Pinecone is simpler but proprietary. ([Milvus](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/how-do-i-choose-between-pinecone-weaviate-milvus-and-other-vector-databases?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How do I choose between Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and other ..."))
* **Lexical engine** : **OpenSearch** (open fork of Elasticsearch) is a good OSS choice if you need no vendor lock; Elastic has more proprietary features but paid. Compare for features/performance before committing. ([Instaclustr](https://www.instaclustr.com/education/opensearch/opensearch-vs-elasticsearch-similarities-and-6-key-differences/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "OpenSearch vs. Elasticsearch: Similarities and 6 key differences"), [Medium](https://medium.com/%40FrankGoortani/opensearch-vs-elasticsearch-a-comprehensive-comparison-in-2025-aff5a8533422?utm_source=chatgpt.com "OpenSearch vs. Elasticsearch: A Comprehensive Comparison in 2025"))
* **Embedding model choices** :
* For English/LEGAL English: Legal-tuned LLM embeddings (open options on Hugging Face) or sentence-transformers fine-tuned on legal text.
* For Indic languages: use AI4Bharat / Indic models (IndicBERT, IndicNER) to build language-appropriate embeddings and for tokenization. ([Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/indic-bert?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ai4bharat/indic-bert - Hugging Face"))
* **Reranking** : Use a lightweight LLM (local Instruct LLM or hosted) to rerank top N results and produce citations/snippets as the RAG context.

---

# 4) Legal NLP modules — research & models

These are the core IP that make this system valuable: doctrine-aware extraction and analytics.

1. **Citation extraction & canonicalization**
   * Extract neutral citations, reporter citations, and hyperlinks.
   * Build a normalization map (SC, HC abbreviations). Use rule-based regex + small supervised model to recover noisy citations.
   * Create a **citation graph** stored in Neo4j (or as graph tables) to allow browsing precedent networks.
2. **Issue / holding / relief extraction (doctrine-aware)**
   * Train a supervised pipeline to split judgments into: Facts, Issues, Holdings, Ratio, Orders/Relief, Reasoning.
   * Use sequence labeling + span extraction (fine-tune transformer models) and cross-document aggregation to identify recurring legal issues (cause of action taxonomy).
3. **Entity extraction for Indian law**
   * Use **IndicNER** and fine-tune on annotated legal entities: Acts, Sections, Parties, Judges, Dates, Amounts, Legal Issues. AI4Bharat resources and IndicNER are a good starting point. ([Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/IndicNER?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ai4bharat/IndicNER - Hugging Face"), [Indic NLP](https://indicnlp.ai4bharat.org/pages/indicnlp-resources/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "IndicNLP Resources - AI4Bharat"))
4. **Summarization & brief generation**
   * Build a controlled summariser that (a) outputs short headnotes and (b) generates an evidence-backed paragraph with explicit citations. Use RAG + local LLMs to avoid hallucinations; ensure final output links back to passages.
5. **Outcome / risk estimator**
   * Train models that predict likely outcomes (win/lose, damages band) from past cases with similar facts. This is exploratory — requires structured labels (we’ll discuss annotation below).
6. **Multilingual handling**
   * Detect language, run language-specific tokenizers and models (IndicBERT/MuRIL) for NER & extraction; then normalize into a single canonical form for indexing. ([Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/indic-bert?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ai4bharat/indic-bert - Hugging Face"), [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/html/2501.15747v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com "IndicMMLU-Pro: Benchmarking the Indic Large Language Models"))

---

# 5) Annotation & dataset creation plan

To build high-quality supervised models you’ll need curated labelled data.

* **Bootstrapping** : auto-extract using rules (citations regex, headings). Use these noisy labels as pretraining.
* **Human annotation** :
* Start with 5k–10k judgments distributed across SC/HC/Commercial courts for: Issue tags, Holdings spans, Reliefs, Citation links, Outcome label.
* Use annotation tool: Label Studio (open) or Doccano; build clear guidelines (legal annotators: paralegals + junior lawyers).
* **Active learning loop** : prioritize examples where models are uncertain for human review.
* **Quality checks** : inter-annotator agreement (Cohen’s kappa) and pilot rounds.

---

# 6) Evaluation metrics & governance

* **Retrieval** : Recall@k, MRR on legal QA tasks using held-out gold citations.
* **Extraction** : F1 for spans (issues, holdings), precision for citations.
* **Summarization** : ROUGE + human legal quality score (does summary capture holding + citation?).
* **Risk estimator** : AUC/accuracy and calibration; present outputs as probabilistic with confidence.
* **Governance & explainability** : every generated claim must show the top-3 grounding passages and citation graph path. Include a human-in-the-loop edit interface.

---

# 7) Frontend & workflows (what the product does)

MVP features:

* Search box (natural language + advanced filters: court, year, act, bench).
* Document viewer with highlights (issues, holdings, citations).
* Citation graph view (interactive; click a node to see its judgment).
* “Draft brief” generator (RAG), with an export to Word/PDF and inline citations.
* Case workspace for docket/cause list tracking (ingest cause lists and match cases automatically).
* Feedback & correction UI for lawyers to correct AI outputs (this feeds back to training).

Stack: React/Next.js front-end, FastAPI backend, Neo4j for citation graph, OpenSearch + Milvus/Weaviate, Postgres for relational data.

---

# 8) Deployment — free vs paid options & recommendations

**Prototype / low cost (free & open)**

* **Hosting** : Hetzner cloud VPS (cheap), or use a small AWS EC2 (t3.small) for prototype. Use Docker Compose for components.
* **Search** : OpenSearch (self-hosted) + Milvus (OSS) for vectors (both can run in Docker). ([Instaclustr](https://www.instaclustr.com/education/opensearch/opensearch-vs-elasticsearch-similarities-and-6-key-differences/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "OpenSearch vs. Elasticsearch: Similarities and 6 key differences"), [Milvus](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/how-does-milvus-compare-to-other-vector-databases-like-pinecone-or-weaviate?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How does Milvus compare to other vector databases like Pinecone ..."))
* **LLMs** : use open checkpoints (smaller LLaMA/Llama-derivatives, or local Hugging Face models) for reranking/summarization on commodity GPUs; if no GPU, use CPU-optimized models (slower).
* **Pros** : Low cost, full control, no vendor lock-in.
* **Cons** : Ops burden, scaling care for vector indexes.

**Production / paid (robust, low-ops)**

* **Hosting** : AWS/GCP/Azure managed services. Use EKS / ECS for scaling and S3 for object storage.
* **Search** : Managed Elastic Cloud or OpenSearch Service;  **Vector DB** : Pinecone or Weaviate Cloud (for managed vector indexing). ([Medium](https://medium.com/%40FrankGoortani/opensearch-vs-elasticsearch-a-comprehensive-comparison-in-2025-aff5a8533422?utm_source=chatgpt.com "OpenSearch vs. Elasticsearch: A Comprehensive Comparison in 2025"), [Milvus](https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/how-do-i-choose-between-pinecone-weaviate-milvus-and-other-vector-databases?utm_source=chatgpt.com "How do I choose between Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, and other ..."))
* **LLMs** : Use hosted LLM APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI, or private model infra: Lambda Labs, CoreWeave) for higher throughput and safety (or LLMs running on cloud GPU instances).
* **Pros** : SLA, easier scaling, fewer ops.
* **Cons** : Cost, potential vendor lock-in, data residency concerns — check Indian data regulation.

**Hybrid recommendation**

* Start OSS self-hosted (OpenSearch + Milvus) for R&D and early customers. For production, migrate vector workloads to managed Pinecone/Weaviate Cloud or host Milvus on Kubernetes with autoscaling. Use hosted LLMs for reranking during early production, then move to private LLMs if cost or data residency becomes a concern.

---

# 9) Security & compliance

* **Data privacy** : judgments are public, but avoid storing sensitive party PII beyond necessary; apply redaction policies if you ingest filings that contain private data.
* **Legal compliance** : check each data source TOS (Indian Kanoon / commercial providers require subscription); prefer official open eCourts/NJDG/SC datasets when possible. ([Department of Justice](https://doj.gov.in/judgment-search-portal/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Judgment Search Portal | Department of Justice | India"))
* **Explainability** : Always surface source passages and let humans override AI outputs.

---

# 10) Cost estimate (very rough) — MVP vs Production

* **MVP (self-hosted, single HC + SC sample)** : hardware + infra ~$100–500/month (cloud VPS + small GPU for model inference) or one-time ~$1–3k for an on-prem GPU workstation.
* **Production (managed services, multi-HC, high throughput)** : $5k–$50k+/month depending on query volume, number of users, and whether LLMs are hosted (hosted LLM inference is the main cost driver). Use managed vector DBs & hosted LLMs for predictable scaling.

---

# 11) Milestones & deliverables (12–20 week roadmap)

Week 0–2: Project setup, data access permissions, pick first courts (e.g., Bombay HC + SC), seed dataset (1–5k judgments).

Week 3–6: Crawler + ingestion pipeline; initial OpenSearch index + embedding pipeline (ColBERT or sentence-transformers). Demo: keyword + semantic search over SC subset. ([GitHub](https://github.com/vanga/indian-supreme-court-judgments?utm_source=chatgpt.com "vanga/indian-supreme-court-judgments - GitHub"))

Week 7–12: Build NER & citation extractor; pilot the citation graph (Neo4j). Add summarization RAG (local LLM for reranking). Demo: query → brief with cited authorities. ([Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat/IndicNER?utm_source=chatgpt.com "ai4bharat/IndicNER - Hugging Face"), [GitHub](https://github.com/terrierteam/pyterrier_colbert?utm_source=chatgpt.com "terrierteam/pyterrier_colbert - GitHub"))
